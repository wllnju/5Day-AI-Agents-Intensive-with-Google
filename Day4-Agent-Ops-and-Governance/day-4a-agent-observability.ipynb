    "# 🔎 Agent Observability - Logs, Traces & Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Welcome to Day 4 of the Kaggle 5-day Agents course!**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Day 3, you learned the **\"What, Why & How\" of Session and Memory management**, focusing on long-term, short-term, and shared memory (state). \n",
    "\n",
    "Today, you'll learn:\n",
    "- How to add observability to the agent you've built and\n",
    "- How to evaluate if the agents are working as expected\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll focus on the first part - **Agent Observability!**\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Agent Observability?\n",
    "\n",
    "**🚨 The challenge:** Unlike traditional software that fails predictably, AI agents can fail mysteriously. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "User: \"Find quantum computing papers\"\n",
    "Agent: \"I cannot help with that request.\"\n",
    "You: 😭 WHY?? Is it the prompt? Missing tools? API error?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**💡 The Solution:** Agent observability gives you complete visibility into your agent's decision-making process. You'll see exactly what prompts are sent to the LLM, which tools are available, how the model responds, and where failures occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "DEBUG Log: LLM Request shows \"Functions: []\" (no tools!)\n",
    "You: 🎯 Aha! Missing google_search tool - easy fix!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Foundational pillars of Agent Observability\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Logs:** A log is a record of a single event, telling you **what** happened at a specific moment.\n",
    "2. **Traces:** A trace connects the logs into a single story, showing you **why** a final result occurred by revealing the entire sequence of steps.\n",
    "3. **Metrics:** Metrics are the summary numbers (like averages and error rates) that tell you **how** well the agent is performing overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "    <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day4/observability-intro.png\">\n",

    "\n",
    "**In this notebook, you'll:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* ✅ Set up logging configuration\n",
    "* ✅ Create a broken agent. Use `adk web` UI & logs to identify exactly why the agent fails\n",
    "* ✅ Understand how to implement logging in production\n",

This algorithm utilizes the wave-like nature of quantum mechanics to create interference patterns that converge on near-optimal solutions for certain optimization problems, which are often intractable for classical computers. This work indicates that large-scale quantum computers could solve specific optimization problems that are beyond the reach of conventional classical computers.\\n\\nThe Journal of Quantum Computing features cutting-edge research in various aspects of quantum computing and information science. Recent articles include \\\"Investigating Techniques to Optimise the Layout of Turbines in a Windfarm Using a Quantum Computer,\\\" which explores using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) on a quantum computer simulator to solve wind farm layout optimization problems. Other published articles cover topics such as 3-Qubit Circular Quantum Convolution Computation, Pancreatic Cancer Data Classification with Quantum Machine Learning, and Advancing Quantum Technology with Mach-Zehnder Interferometers.\\n\\nThe journal *Quantum* also published numerous papers in 2023, including research on \\\"Measurement-based quantum computation in finite one-dimensional systems,\\\" \\\"Robust Extraction of Thermal Observables from State Sampling and Real-Time Dynamics on Quantum Computers,\\\" and \\\"General quantum algorithms for Hamiltonian simulation\\\". Additionally, \\\"Quantum algorithm for ground state energy estimation using circuit depth\\\" and \\\"Operational meanings of a generalized conditional expectation in quantum metrology\\\" are among the published works.\\n\\nQuEra Computing has published research in 2025 on topics like \\\"ResQ: A Novel Framework to Implement Residual Neural Networks on Analog Rydberg Atom Quantum Computers\\\" and \\\"Quantum Adiabatic Generation of Human-Like Passwords.\\\" They also have work on \\\"Quantum Adiabatic Optimization with Rydberg Arrays\\\" and \\\"qReduMIS: A Quantum-Informed Reduction Algorithm for the Maximum Independent Set Problem\\\".\\n\\nA total of 2194 papers were found.\"}],\"role\":\"model\"},\"finishReason\":\"STOP\",\"usageMetadata\":{\"candidatesTokenCount\":400,\"promptTokenCount\":1103,\"promptTokensDetails\":[{\"modality\":\"TEXT\",\"tokenCount\":1103}],\"totalTokenCount\":1503},\"invocationId\":\"e-2958451a-1b81-4a52-a683-c8b47c54f557\",\"author\":\"research_paper_finder_agent\",\"actions\":{\"stateDelta\":{},\"artifactDelta\":{},\"requestedAuthConfigs\":{},\"requestedToolConfirmations\":{}},\"id\":\"40b32148-07d6-414b-b5d1-cb551b192e42\",\"timestamp\":1763114850.7759}\n",

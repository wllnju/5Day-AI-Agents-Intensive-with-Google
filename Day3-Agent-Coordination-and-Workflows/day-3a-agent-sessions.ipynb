The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.

But real conversations involve hundreds of such characteristics:\n- User preferences and habits\n- Past interactions and their outcomes\n- Domain knowledge and expertise levels\n- Communication styles and patterns\n- Contextual relationships between topics\n\n**The Memory System in ADK automates this entire process**, making it a valuable asset for building truly Context-Aware Agents that can accommodate any user's current and future needs.\n\nIn the next notebook (Part 2: Memory Management), you'll learn how to:\n- Enable automatic memory extraction from conversations\n- Build agents that learn and adapt over time\n- Create truly personalized experiences at scale\n- Manage long-term knowledge across sessions\n\nReady to transform your manual state management into an intelligent, automated Memory system?
